# 2.2tpconvert
Convert 2.1 texture packs to 2.2

For now only icons texture packs are supported!!!

I just made this script like 2 days ago lol, haven't tested the results ingame either so bugs are to be expected

# Usage
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```
Or use the exe in [release](https://github.com/Weebifying/2.2tpconvert/releases/latest)

You need to have both GameSheet02 and GameSheetGlow pngs and plists in your input folder


# Todo list:
- Support for all textures
