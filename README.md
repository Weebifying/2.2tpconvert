# 2.2tpconvert
Convert 2.1 icons texture packs to 2.2

I just made this script like 2 days ago lol, haven't tested the results ingame either so bugs are expected

# Usage
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```
You need to have both Gamesheet02 and GamesheetGlow pngs and plists in your input folder


# Todo list:
- Support for all textures
